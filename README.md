# The Allium web app

## Summary

The Allium is a front end React App designed to function as Reddit style article/news website, with social media aspects such as commenting on article posts, upvoting (or downvoting) articles and comments, and viewing particular users and the articles they have posted.

This is the user interface which interacts with the Express/Node/PostGreSQL back end I have made, linked below!

### You may:

- View all articles posted by users
- Sort the articles by various means
- Use the nav bar to filter by specifc topics
- Click on any username to be redirected to their home hub, where you can see all articles this user has posted
- View an individual article
- Upvote or downvote individual articles
- View the individual article's comments
- Upvote or downvote individual comments
- Write and post a comment as the user you are logged in as
- Delete the comments of the user you are logged in as
